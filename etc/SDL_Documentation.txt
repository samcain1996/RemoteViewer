SDL_Texture: Contains driver-specific representation of pizel data
SDL_Surface: Collection of pixels
SDL_RWops: Abstract interface to stream I/O
SDL_Renderer: Contains a renderering state

Functions:
SDL_FreeSurface: Frees memory. NULL-safe.
SDL_DestroyTexture / SDL_DestroyRenderer: Frees memory. NOT NULL-safe.

SDL_LoadBMP_RW: Load BMP image from SDL data stream. Setting the second parameter to SDL_TRUE frees SDL_RWops after use. (Must call SDL_FreeSurface after).
SDL_RenderCopy: Copy texture to renderer. NULL srcrect -> Use entire texture, NULL dstrect -> Stretch to entire render target
SDL_RenderPresent: Render image
