1. A trivial move constructor is a constructor that performs the same action as the trivial copy constructor, that is, 
   makes a copy of the object representation as if by std::memmove. All data types compatible with the C language (POD types) are trivially movable. 

   1a. A Plain Old Data Structure in C++ is an aggregate class that contains only PODS as members, has no user-defined destructor, 
	   no user-defined copy assignment operator, and no nonstatic members of pointer-to-member type.

2. The implicitly-declared copy constructor for class T is undefined if T has a user-defined move constructor
   or move assignment operator (this condition only causes the implicitly-declared, not the defaulted, copy constructor to be deleted). 

3. A class defined with the keyword class has private access for its members and its base classes by default. A class defined with the
   keyword struct has public access for its members and its base classes by default

4. Const before pointer means the objected pointed at is const. Const after pointer means the pointer itself can not be changed.
