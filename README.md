Remote Viewer
=============

Remote Viewer is an application that will allow
one computer to control the keyboard and mouse input
of another while simultaneously receiving a video feed
of the desktop. 

Currently it will work only with Windows but hopefully support
will be expanded to macOS and linux.

This application relies on the Boost C++ library
which can be found here: https://www.boost.org/
